# \<T\>LAPACK Examples

We provide a few examples to show how to use \<T\>LAPACK. Each example has its own directory with separate build and description. They all assume that \<T\>LAPACK is [installed](../README.md#installation).

This is the list of examples and brief descriptions:

- [geqr2](geqr2/README.md)
  
  Compute the QR factorization of a matrix filled with random numbers.

- [gemm](gemm/README.md)

  Compute _C - AB_ using matrices A, B and C.

- [cwrapper_gemm](cwrapper_gemm/README.md)

  Compute _C - AB_ using matrices A, B and C with a code written in C language.
